## solution
## pseudocode
function consecutiveSubstrings(string):
    Initialize empty result array
    
    For each start index from 0 to string.length - 1:
        For each end index from start index to string.length - 1:
            Take substring from start to end (inclusive)
            Add to result array
    
    Return result array
    // explatination to the solution
    The use of nested loops generate a start and end position combination.
    thus ensureing  all consecutive substrings are captured. The outer loop sets the starting point, while the inner loop extends to the end. 
    This approach has O(n^3) (Cubic Complexity) complexity due to substring creation across all positions.

   ## Algorithm:
The solution uses a two-pointer approach with nested loops:

1.Outer loop (i variable) iterates over all possible starting positions (0 to n-1)
2.Inner loop (j variable) iterates from current starting position to end of string
3.For each combination of i and j, extract substring using string.slice(i, j + 1)
4.Add substring to result array
