## pseudocode
FUNCTION consecutiveSubstrings(string):
    // Initialize empty array to store results
    result = []
    
    // Outer loop: iterate through all possible starting positions
    FOR i FROM 0 TO string.length - 1:
        
        // Inner loop: iterate through all possible ending positions starting from i
        FOR j FROM i TO string.length - 1:
            
            // Extract substring from position i to position j (inclusive)
            substring = string.slice(i, j + 1)
            
            // Add substring to results array
            result.push(substring)
    
    // Return array containing all consecutive substrings
    RETURN result
    \

    // explatination to the solution
    The use of nested loops generate a start and end position combination.
    thus ensureing  all consecutive substrings are captured. The outer loop sets the starting point, while the inner loop extends to the end. 
    This approach has O(n^2) (quadratic time) complexity due to substring creation across all positions.

   ## Algorithm:
The solution uses a two-pointer approach with nested loops:

1.Outer loop (i variable) iterates over all possible starting positions (0 to n-1)
2.Inner loop (j variable) iterates from current starting position to end of string
3.For each combination of i and j, extract substring using string.slice(i, j + 1)
4.Add substring to result array
